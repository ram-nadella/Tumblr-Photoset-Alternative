Tumblr Photoset Alternative
===========================

An alternative to the photoset viewer offered by Tumblr.


Problem
-------

Tumblr offers a lot options in terms of theming except when it comes to 
'photosets' there is only the standard flash based gallery viewer that 
automatically starts playing a slideshow. I think this is inadequate, 
especially if you are using Tumblr to show a lot of high-res pictures.


Solution
--------

Hide the default photoset, using Tumblr's API, fetch the images in the 
photoset and display them as you like.

The code here shows the images one after the other as if they are multiple 
photo posts, except they are all in single post.

Requirements
------------
* jQuery
